\textit{This abstract needs to be updated for the paper.}\\
Turbulent magnetic fluctuations are ubiquitous in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas that exhibit power-law broadband fluctuations and intermittency. Power-law like broadband fluctuations indicate an energy-cascade where energy is injected at large scales and cascades to smaller and smaller scales where energy is ``dissipated'' via some mechanism. Intermittency in the magnetic fluctuations is associated with current sheets or coherent structures. This talk focuses on understanding the dissipation scale and the intermittent behavior of the magnetic fluctuations. The fluid Taylor scale is investigated as a potential dissipation scale. The Taylor scale is obtained through multi-point correlations of broadband fluctuations. From the spatial and temporal correlations respectively, the measured Taylor scales are $2\pm1cm$ and $3\pm1cm$. Intermittency in magnetic fluctuations is investigated through a statistical analysis of temporal and spatial increments: the probability density function of increments and its moments, i.e. structure functions.

\section{For Whom am I writing for?}
I am writing for new graduate students entering the field of plasma turbulence.\\

\caption{\label{fig:wave_psd} The magnetic fields measured at $z = 41.6cm$. The highlighted region is the analysis region.}
\end{figure}

What is the Taylor scale in a turbulent laboratory plasma?
The Taylor scale in a turbulent laboratory plasma is $\sim4.6cm$.\\

Does the Taylor scale correspond to dissipation features in the spectra?
The Taylor scale corresponds to a steepening expected in dissipation.

\caption{\label{fig:wave_psd} The $|\vb{B}|$ wavenumber power spectral density at three positions: $41.6cm$, $59.8cm$, and $78.0cm$. I used the Taylor scale to partition the wavenumber power spectral density into two regions. The spectral index steepens on average from $-3.2$ to $-5.0$.}

Is intermittency observed in the magnetic fluctuations?
Intermittency is present in the magnetic fluctuations.\\

\begin{figure}

\caption{\label{fig:intermit_0.2} The histogram of $0.2\mu s$ increments. The histogram deviates from a Gaussian histogram, $0.2\mu s$ increments from random data. This features indicates that intermittency is present in the magnetic fluctuations.}
\end{figure}


Is there spacial variation in intermittency?
Intermittency does not appear to vary spatially statistically.\\
